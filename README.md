# Amoebiasis

Is a mod for the web game [Agario](https://agar.io) It included several unique features found in no other mods. Please note that the Agario community at large considers many of the features contained in this mod hacks or cheats as it could be argued that they give you an unfair advantage over others.

Also includes a bot we like to call the "grazer" which helps with the grunt work of collecting food pellets in the early game.

##Feature List
1. Auto-grazing (bot-like feeding on pellets) with optional target analysis visualization
   * P will enable target-fixation. With fixation on new targets are calculated only after previously chosen one is destroyed. With it off, targets are recalculated every new update, which is roughly 25 times per second, which is resource intensive and can eat up laptop battery life. 
   * With fixation on you can press 'T' to retarget to the cluster of cells nearest to the mouse cursor.
   * You can press 'V' to toggle display of target analysis lines.
2. Split Kill range indicator
   * Inner ring displays base jump distance for all cells. Your split cell will land so its center is half-in/half-out of inner circle. Outer circle shows how far out beyond the center circle your cell will land.
3. Viruses now display number of times it needs to be fed mass to make it split.
4. Display blob danger/edibility via color
   * Red - it can split and eat you
   * Orange - it can eat you, but not if it splits
   * Yellow - Same size as you
   * Green - you can eat it, but not if you split
   * Purple - you can split and still eat it
5. Each blob will display percent based on how much bigger or smaller than you it is.
6. Each of your blobs displays number of times you can use eject mass(if display mass is enabled)
7. press R to target virus (outlined in red) nearest to blob 0 and shoot exact # of shots to split.
8. press E to target nearest virus o cursor and shoot exact # of shots to split
   * Optionally, press 'O' to make left-click do same as 'E', allowing you to split viruses with a mouse click.
9. Time-To-Remerge (TTR) timer displayed on each blob that estimates when your cell will be allowed to remerge.
   * After a split one cell may already display a negative value. This is by design
10. Z to zoom in/out. Mouse scroll wheel can also be used to activate.
11. Server Select UI (Thanks to Angal for use of his code)
12. Automatically save and autofill last-used username
13. Agariomods.com skins support http://skins.agariomods.com/ 
14. Connect.Agariomods.com skins support http://connect.agariomods.com/

## Philosophy of Javier Cañon
* KISS by design and programming. An acronym for "keep it simple, stupid" or "keep it stupid simple", is a design principle. The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided. Variations on the phrase include: "Keep it simple, silly", "keep it short and simple", "keep it simple and straightforward", "keep it small and simple", or "keep it stupid simple".

* Select the best tools for the job, use tools that take less time to finish the job.
* Productivity over complexity and avoid unnecessary complexity for elegant or beauty code.

* Computers are machines, more powerful every year, give them hard work, concentrate on being productive.
